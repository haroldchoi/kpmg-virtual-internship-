# kpmg-virtual-internship

### In this virtual internship experience, I assessed the data quality and completeness of a company specialising in the sales of branded bicycles. There were 3 datasets included namely the customer demographic, customer transaction and transaction data. The customer demographic dataset included customer details like date of birth, name, gender, job, job title and wealth segment. The customer address included address and state. Lastly, the transaction dataset included brand purchased, cost, price, margins for each product. 

### The dataset were joined using transaction id and customer id. After removing duplicates, cleaning the unneccessary columnns, inputting age the datasets were joined and ready for analysis. 

### The goal of the project was to target high value customers within Australia. I gain insights using various methods like using visualisations to understand the price paid, demographic of the age of customers, test the normality of each data and which customers are spending the most amount based on their wealth segment.

### Lastly, a dashboard was created and presented to showcase all the relevant and important insights gain to help improve the marketing of the bicycle company.
